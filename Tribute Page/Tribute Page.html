          Abdul Rashid Salim Salman Khan was born on December 27, 1965, in
          Mumbai to legendary screenwriter Salim Khan, who penned many
          super-hits in the yesteryear's like Sholay (1975), Deewaar (1975), and
          Don (1978). Khan started his acting career by doing a supporting role
          in the movie Biwi Ho To Aisi (1988). The following year he had the
          leading role in the box office romantic hit When Love Calls (1989).
          From there he became a heartthrob of Indian cinema. Following with
          other box office hits he showed his terrific performance in Saajan
          (1991), Andaz Apna Apna (1994), Hum Aapke Hain Koun...! (1994), Karan
          Arjun (1995), Khamoshi the Musical (1996), Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998).
          His transformations can be sensitive, vulnerable, funny, aggressive
          and charming as his role demands.
